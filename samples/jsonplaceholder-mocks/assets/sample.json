      "This sample demonstrates how Dev Proxy can mock API responses using the popular JSONPlaceholder API as an example. JSONPlaceholder is a free fake REST API commonly used for testing and prototyping, making it perfect for showcasing Dev Proxy's mocking capabilities. The sample provides a complete working example of API mocking, where all responses clearly indicate they are generated by Dev Proxy through custom headers and modified response content. This makes it easy to see Dev Proxy in action and understand how it intercepts and replaces API calls with mock responses. Perfect for learning how to configure API mocking for any REST API."
