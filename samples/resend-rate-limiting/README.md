# Simulate rate limiting on Resend APIs

## Summary

This sample contains a preset to simulate rate limiting on Resend APIs. Resend APIs support rate limiting, which is a mechanism that informs developers of the available server resources and allows them to increase the data throughput by staying under the rate limits and avoiding throttling.
