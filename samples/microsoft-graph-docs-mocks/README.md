# Microsoft Graph mocks from Microsoft Graph API docs

## Summary

This sample contains mocks for the Microsoft Graph API based on the Microsoft Graph API documentation. Mocks are created based on sample requests and responses included in the Microsoft Graph documentation.

Using these mocks, you can simulate calling Microsoft Graph API without having to connect to the actual service. This is useful for testing and development purposes. These mocks are also helpful when you want to demo time-sensitive functionality such as recently opened files, without having to generate activity on your tenant for Microsoft Graph to return the data.

## Minimal path to awesome

- Clone this repository (or [download this solution as a .ZIP file](https://pnp.github.io/download-partial/?url=https://github.com/pnp/proxy-samples/tree/main/samples/microsoft-graph-docs-mocks) then unzip it)
- Start Dev Proxy specifying the path to one of the mock files, eg. `devproxy --mocks-file graph-proxy-mocks.json`

## Features

The sample contains three mock files:

- mocks for Microsoft Graph v1.0 endpoints (`graph-v1_0-proxy-mocks.json`)
- mocks for Microsoft Graph beta endpoints (`graph-beta-proxy-mocks.json`)
- mocks combining both v1.0 and beta endpoints (`graph-proxy-mocks.json`)

If you only use v1.0 or beta Microsoft Graph endpoints, you can load the specific mocks file for better performance. If you want to mock requests to both v1.0 and beta endpoints, you can use the combined file instead.
