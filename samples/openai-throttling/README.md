# Simulate throttling of the OpenAI API

## Summary

This sample contains a preset and mocks to simulate the throttling of the OpenAI API.

As more and more applications use OpenAI API to use AI, it's important that developers can verify that their apps can properly handle cases when the API is throttled. Especially when the app is using lower-tier API plans, throttling is more likely to happen so validating the app's behavior is crucial to ensure great user experience.

Using this preset you can simulate throttling of the OpenAI API and see how your app will handle it.

## Minimal path to awesome

- Clone this repository (or [download this solution as a .ZIP file](https://pnp.github.io/download-partial/?url=https://github.com/pnp/proxy-samples/tree/main/samples/microsoft-graph-docs-mocks) then unzip it)
- Start Dev Proxy specifying the path to one of the mock files, eg. `devproxy --config-file openai-config.json`

## Features

This preset includes configuration for simulating 3 different throttling scenarios:

- exceeded tokens per minute
  ![Dev Proxy simulating throttling of the OpenAI API when exceeded the number of tokens per minute](assets/throttling-tokens.png)
- exceeded number of requests per minute
  ![Dev Proxy simulating throttling of the OpenAI API when exceeded the number of requests per minute](assets/throttling-requests.png)
- service overload, which includes dynamic simulation of handling retry-after
  ![Dev Proxy simulating throttling of the OpenAI API when the server is overloaded](assets/throttling-overloaded.png)

Proxy will simulate throttling the API using one of these modes at random.
