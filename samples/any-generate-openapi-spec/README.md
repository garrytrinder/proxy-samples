# Generate an OpenAPI spec for any API

## Summary

This sample contains a preset that allows you to generate an OpenAPI spec for any API. By specifying the URLs of the API for which you want to generate an OpenAPI spec, Dev Proxy will intercept all requests to that API and generate an OpenAPI spec based on the requests and responses.

## Features

This is a generic preset for generating OpenAPI specs for any API. The preset doesn't contain a URL and requires you to specify the URL using the `--urls-to-watch, -u` option.

For more information about the configuration options, see the [documentation of the OpenApiSpecGenerator](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-cloud/dev/dev-proxy/technical-reference/openapispecgeneratorplugin).
